Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is JoÃ£o Gabriel, but you can call me **Spinelli** (He/Him)!

Iâ€™m a technology enthusiast, a geek, a amateur chef, and a noob pianist (started to learn in 2021).

Since august 2021, i started my journey to become a fullStack Dev Jr at Trybe!, as of now we just started the back-end module.

Here you can find some of the projects that i developed in my year long training, Trybetunes is one of my favorites, check-it out!

Iâ€™m currently working on the TrybeWallet project, a expenses control system with an currency converter, that i implemented using an API, right now, iâ€™ am finalizing the CSS!

You can reach out to me by email: jgsspinelli92@gmail.com.

lets talk about, technology, food, music or anything geekish!
